    <p>
      A smokescreen covered their continuous blinks towards the outskirts of
      the great kingdom, until the cathedral was the only thing clearly
      visible. Along the way, they could sense the great shadow of a Dragon,
      watching their every step. Then, the voices of survivors seeking revenge
      towards the witch echoed through the destroyed cathedral halls. Others
      were tending to their wounded, others were trying to collect the
      Enlightened's burning husk from the great funeral pyre, whilst the
      archbishop was chanting blessings, leading the flock of peasants as if
      they were warriors, preparing to battle the mighty dragon..

        Aleister, the former demonlord, is always looking at others bearing a
        malefic grin upon his twisted visage, harnessing all the power he can
        muster as he directs bolts of pure chaos towards his foes.
      </p>
      <p class="nv2">
        The only place Hecate feels safe is total Darkness, where she
        envelopes herself and thrives, until it totally consumes her
        existence. Until that strange familiar odor which vanished, reappears
        and stabs you - in the Dark.
      </p>

      <p class="nv3">
        Theregar's smile looks intimidating as it is, yet is amplified by the
        fel green hue of the enchantments he is preparing: As he deflects his
        attackers, his foes are enlightened by his immense control of the
        Shadows...

        Void claimed all in the Halls of Reflection as Roth rised from the
        Stone, his voice echoing again in the sultry darkness. His enemies
        fallen, their eyesight blurred, their powers escaping their body as he
        consumed their souls...

      The ornate peace of these halls would be shattered now and then by the
      faint whispers of the Statue of a thousand faces, as the soul fragments
      collided and the Heroes met in glorious Combat. For them it would always
      be the first time, until someone's time to be free of this burden would
      come - then he'd regain consciousness of who he was and what he had to do.</p>
    <p> But, this time, something was different.</p>
